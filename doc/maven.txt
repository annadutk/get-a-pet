Maven is used to manage several aspects of the project, including
dependency management and compilation/assembly.

The project can be built from the following command:

mvn clean package

The WAR file is created under a name like target/project-0.war. It can
be deployed to Tomcat simply by copying to the Tomcat webapps
directory.

The Maven project can also be imported into Eclipse with m2e and
m2e-wtp integration, using File > Import,Maven > Existing Maven
Projects. Eclipse uses several settings from the Maven project, so
Maven is also useful for centralized project configuration.
