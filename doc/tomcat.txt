The JDBC URL and class name should never be mentioned in the webapp.
Instead, they are configured in the application server and provided
to the webapp under a JNDI name.

The webapp is designed to lookup a pre-configured DataSource under the
JNDI name: java:/comp/env/jdbc/get_a_pet

The DataSource can be configured with the following segment in
context.xml. It is a child of the root Context element:

	<Resource
		name="jdbc/get_a_pet"
		auth="Container"
		type="javax.sql.DataSource"
		driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
		url="jdbc:mysql://localhost/get_a_pet"
		username="user"
		password="password"

		maxActive="100"
		maxIdle="30"
		maxWait="10000"
	/>
